# Lane & Vehicle Detection System

OpenCV image processing algorithm for lane & vehicle detection in autonomous cars

# Features to Complete

* Processed frame for canny edges and hough lines (Done)
* Cut areas outside region of interest to remove noise (Done - might vary per size of car)
* Overlaid two averaged lines per frame (Done - not very smooth)
* Filled rectangular area between lines (Done)
* Vehicle & traffic sign detection (TODO - train ML model to do this)
